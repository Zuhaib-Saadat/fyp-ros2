[33mCMake Warning (dev) at /usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/cmake/pcl/Modules/FindFLANN.cmake:45 (find_package):
  Policy CMP0144 is not set: find_package uses upper-case <PACKAGENAME>_ROOT
  variables.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0144" for policy details.  Use the
  cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this warning.

  CMake variable FLANN_ROOT is set to:

    /usr

  For compatibility, find_package is ignoring the variable, but code in a
  .cmake module might still use it.

[33mCMake Warning at CMakeLists.txt:32 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findgrid_map_ros.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "grid_map_ros", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "grid_map_ros" with
  any of the following names:

    grid_map_rosConfig.cmake
    grid_map_ros-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "grid_map_ros" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "grid_map_ros_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "grid_map_ros" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
